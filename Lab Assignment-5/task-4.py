def score_applicant(experience_years, education_level, skills_match, interview_score, certifications_count):
    """
    Scores a job applicant based on multiple features and classifies their suitability.

    Parameters:
    - experience_years (float): Number of years of relevant work experience.
    - education_level (str): Highest education level achieved. Expected values:
        'high_school', 'bachelor', 'master', 'phd'
    - skills_match (float): Percentage (0-100) indicating how well the applicant's skills match the job requirements.
    - interview_score (float): Score (0-10) from the interview evaluation.
    - certifications_count (int): Number of relevant certifications the applicant holds.

    Returns:
    - dict: Contains 'total_score' (float) and 'classification' (str), one of:
      - 'Rejected'
      - 'Consider'
      - 'Strong Candidate'

    Scoring logic:
    - Experience weighted by 30%
    - Education weighted by 20% (mapped to numeric score)
    - Skills match weighted by 25%
    - Interview weighted by 20%
    - Certifications weighted by 5%
